This project took me a little bit of extra time because I haven't used Java in about a year and I have never worked with JSON.
I spent some time looking for a library to work with JSON files and found Gson to be the easiest for me to understand because it has good documentation and an API. (https://google.github.io/gson/apidocs/)

I then looked for the best way to parse the document for easy lookup of elements while keeping them within their view.
The code for this is a little bit messy, but I put in some comments to help guide you.

The file is located in the same directory as the project.
Put in the full path of the json file.
